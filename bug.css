This error occurs when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a class that's also using other Tailwind directives or styles.  The `@apply` directive attempts to inject styles that conflict with pre-existing styles defined in the parent class or elsewhere. This can lead to unexpected CSS overrides, styles not being applied correctly, or even complete style loss.

For example:
```css
.my-class {
  @apply bg-gray-100;
  padding: 2rem;
}
```
If another rule already defines `padding` for `.my-class`, it will clash, potentially causing the `padding` set by the `@apply` directive to be ignored or overridden unpredictably.
