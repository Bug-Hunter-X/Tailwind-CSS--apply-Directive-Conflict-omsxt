To solve this, ensure that `@apply` directives are used consistently and carefully. Avoid using `@apply` within classes that already have extensive inline styles.  A better approach is to either:

1. **Separate Concerns:** Create separate classes for different styles. Use utility-first approaches where applicable, combining only necessary classes.   This makes style interactions far more predictable.

2. **Refactor to Utility-First:** Transition to a more utility-first Tailwind approach.  Instead of using `@apply` for complex styles, use a combination of individual Tailwind utility classes to achieve the same result. This avoids the complexity and ambiguity of `@apply` directives.

Example Solution:
```css
.my-class {
  @apply bg-gray-100;
}
.my-class-padding {
  padding: 2rem;
}
```

Now the styles are independent and won't clash.  Apply both classes as needed:

```html
<div class="my-class my-class-padding"></div>
```
